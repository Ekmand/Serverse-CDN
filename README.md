# Serverse-CDN
I see you've stumbled upon my little dead simple "CDN" that's not a CDN xD. This is gonna be for my project, Serverse. It's a mix between the word server and universe. Pretty clever right? It's gonna be a site like top.gg and disboard, except it's gonna be better looking, and so much better to use. Not only with a better interface, a better way to add servers, tons of curated servers and bots, better ways to discover the servers that you love, but it will also allow you to add your server to the hopefully gigantic server network (assuming we can get the serverse to grow). Plus, premium features that websites charge for like custom profiles will be free. Same with discovering your server.

## When is serverse gonna be complete?
There's no estimate since I am a single dev on this project, but if you're interested in helping make a better way to discover communities, I'm all for it. The sooner we can get this built the better, as we'll be making the world of discord a better place ;) 

## So what features are planned for Serverse?
So far, these are the features that I plan to add.
-Server search
-Server discovery
-Bot discovery
-Curated bots and servers
-User profiles like https://beacons.page
-And so much more
